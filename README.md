# Data-Centric Development Milestone Project (Project3) : Recipesuccess

Recipesuccess is a website that user can saved his/her recipes here and is also a public library of recipes. 
I want to ensure that user has an easy time referring to his/her own recipes hence the recipe display is structured in table format with each row
storing a particular step and relating ingredients/tools/tips. The organised structure will also be beneficial for the public to see how ingredients/tips/tools are used for every step. It will look less daunting and user
has a higher chance to cook the recipe. The organised structure giving viewer a bird eye view of the whole recipe process enables ease and confidence to tweak any aspects of the recipe to his/her own convenience.
My deployed website is [here](https://nks-project3-mongodb.herokuapp.com/).

The project looks fine across different browsers like edge, chrome or firefox. I am using chrome primarily most of the time when debugging.
In smaller devices, I have reduce the columns in the tables in "My recipes page" & "Recipes page" so that the table of content will generally be confined in the constraint of the device width.
Due to associating most of the primary tags with bootstrap CSS, hence the contents mobile responsives are pretty much organised and set by bootstrap already.
